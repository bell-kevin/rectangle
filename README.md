# rectangle
Write a class definition for a Rectangle class that contains: 

-Two int fields, length and width     
-Mutator and accessor methods for the length and width fields. Ask the user for these values in the mutator methods.     
-A Boolean method named isSquare that returns true if the rectangle’s length and width are the same and false otherwise.     
-A method that returns the perimeter of the rectangle     
-A method that returns the area of the rectangle  

Write a class definition for a Rectangle Driver class that tests all of the methods.

-Create a Rectangle object named paper.     
-Use the mutator methods to assign user-input values for the length and width fields     
-Use the Boolean method to determine if paper is a square.         
  +If it is a square, print “This paper is a square: ” and the square’s dimensions         
  +If it is not a square, print “This paper is a rectangle: ” and the rectangle’s dimensions         
  +Be sure to use the accessor methods to retrieve the dimensions for printing.     
-Print out the rectangle’s perimeter and area

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[email me](bellKevin.me) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
